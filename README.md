# Tic-tac-toe
# This Python program uses Tkinter to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for a two-player Tic Tac Toe game. The game allows two users to play against each other on a 3x3 grid, taking turns to place their respective symbols (X or O) on the board. The goal is to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win the game.

#The GUI has the following features:

#Game Board: A 3x3 grid made up of buttons. Each button represents a cell in the Tic Tac Toe board.
#Player Turns: The game alternates between Player X and Player O, displaying whose turn it is.
#Win Detection: The program checks for winning combinations after each move and declares the winner if a player aligns three symbols.
#Draw Detection: If all cells are filled without a winner, the game declares a draw.
#Restart Option: After a win or draw, the game can be reset for a new round.
The program uses event-driven programming, where button clicks trigger actions such as placing symbols, checking for wins, and updating the game state.
